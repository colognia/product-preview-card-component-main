## My process

- build html
- create css
- check and verify frequently with Firefox and its developer console
- consulting my own notes regarding usage of tags/options, consulting developers.mozilla.org and w3schools


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- editor: visual studio code

### What I learned
More about grids and positioning items inside. To exchange pictures thru display: none/unset; was my way to exchange pictures for different screen sizes.

### Continued development
Learn more about grids and media queries.
I am unsure about sizing of maincontainer, because we do not have values. Relative units do not work, because screen width changes and you want some respnsove margin.
